# Conway's "Game of Life", written in different languages

Write a basic Conway Game of Life game in different programming languages with different goals (fast execution, elegant code or small codebase).

## Languages

- [Crystal](/crystal/README.md)
- [Go](/go/README.md)
- [Ruby](/ruby/README.md)
- [Swift](/swift/README.md)

## Solutions

The first solution (for example *Ruby 1*) works with two classes, one for the grid and one for the game. The grid class use a array to store the cell information.

## Benchmarks

Benchmark test with a 100x100 grid, 1 glider and 1000 rounds.

| Language  | Duration | LoC |

| Go 1      |  2,17s   | 165 |
| Ruby 1    | 25,38s   | 134 |
| Swift 1   |  2,41s   | 142 |
