# Conway's Game of Life Challenge

Write a basic Conway Game of Life game in different programming languages with different goals (fast execution, elegant code or small codebase).

## Languages

- C (planned)
- C++ (planned)
- [Crystal](/crystal/README.md)
- Common Lisp (planned)
- CSharp (planned)
- Elisp (planned)
- Elixir (planned)
- [Go](/go/README.md)
- Nim (planned)
- Perl (planned)
- Python (planned)
- [Ruby](/ruby/README.md)
- Rust (planned)
- Scheme (planned)
- Swift (planned)

## Solutions

The first solution (for example *Ruby 1*) works with two classes, one for the grid and one for the game. The grid class use a array to store the cell information.

## Benchmarks

Benchmark test with a 100x100 grid, 1 glider and 1000 rounds.
