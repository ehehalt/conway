# Conway's Game of Life Challenge

Write a basic Conway Game of Life game in different programming languages with different goals (fast execution, elegant code or small codebase).

## Languages

- [Crystal](/crystal/README.md)
- [Ruby](/ruby/README.md)

## Solutions

The first solution (for example *Ruby 1*) works with two classes, one for the grid and one for the game. The grid class is a 2D interface on an 1D array.

## Benchmarks

Performance test with a 100x100 grid, 1 glider and 1000 rounds.
